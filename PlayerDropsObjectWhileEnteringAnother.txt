Repro Steps:
	1. Spawn more than one task object
	2. Pick one up
	3. Outside of the collider of another task object, move towards it.
	4. Release the current held object and stop movement so that the previously held object rolls out of range of the player.
	5. While still in the collider of the other task object, press the interaction key.

Actual results:
	When attempting to pick up the second task object, it will fail to assign the event properly. Something about this seems to prevent the player from picking up any other task object from this point on.

Expected Results:
	The player's priority task object should shift to the closest distance. Interaction should immediately become possible and interaction attempts should result in the object being picked up by the player.
